            <h2 class="text-background">About Me</h2>
            <p class="text-background">Hello! Thank you for taking the time to take a look at 
                my portfolio! My name is Kiyara Hill, pronounced KEE-R-UH. I have my Bachelor
                of Science in Mechanical Engineering from UNCC, however I have recently discovered
                a passion for web development. I am currently a Quality Systems Engineer at Niagara Bottling,
                a manufacturing company where I've been for 3.5 years now. I started as a Manufacturing Intern
                fresh out of college in May 2020. I was then promoted to the Manufacturing Development Program
                 as a Manufacturing Engineer, where I completed a 15 month rotational Program. In the program, 
                 new graduates get to rotate through all the departments within a plant and act as a Supervisor 
                 for that department for a few months. Once I graduated fromt he MDP I then was promoted to the 
                 position I have now.
            </p>
            <p class="text-background">As a Quality Systems Engineer I maintain the applications we use for Quality 
                DAQ across all plants in our network. These systems include, but are not limited to, Presage, InfinityQS, 
                Sharepoint, and (my personal favorite) Ignition. On Ignition, our team has created and maintained a quality 
                DAQ website application for the plants across Niagara to log hourly quality data. To date we manage 45 plants' 
                databases and Ignition projects between 2 people (myself being one of them, incase that wasnt evident). While 
                working with Ignition I have become fluent in Python, SQL, and found my passion for website/application 
                development. This passion is what sparked this web development journey.
            </p>
            <p class="text-background">Right now in order to pursue my passion as a developer I have decided to start Angela Yu's "The Complete 2023 Web 
                Development Bootcamp" Udemy course. Through the course one of our first projects was to build a website for our portfolios. 
                Though I have decided to continue to document all other projects I work on as I start my journey on learning more 
                about web development.
            </p>
            <p class="text-background">Make sure to check back here very so often to check out progress as I add on 
                to this website! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</p>
